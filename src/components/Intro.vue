      As part of an on-going effort to increase transparency around how the City
      spends your tax dollars, the City Controller’s Office is releasing
      information about the revenue and spending for the Philadelphia Beverage
      Tax. This release offers an update on the Beverage Tax through the third
      quarter of fiscal year 2021 (March 31, 2021).
    </p>
    <p>
      This release includes data on individual expenditure items associated with
      the main Beverage Tax spending areas: Pre-K, Community Schools, and
      Rebuild.<sup><a id="ref1" class="footnote" href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> All
      data is taken directly from the City of Philadelphia’s general ledger
      system, FAMIS, which is used to track departmental spending. For each
      spending area, users can view summaries of the expenditures by vendor name
      and spending category, as well as search for individual expenditures using
      an interactive table. The complete data set, which includes expenditures
      from July 1, 2017 to March 31, 2021, can be downloaded using the button at
      the top of this page.

      Mayor James Kenney proposed the Philadelphia Beverage Tax in 2016 to fund
      the City of Philadelphia’s Pre-K expansion and Community Schools program
      and to pay debt obligations for the bond borrowing for Rebuild. The tax, a
      1.5-cents per ounce levy, took effect on January 1, 2017. In its first
      year of operation, the City funded 2,000 Pre-K seats and 9 Community
      Schools through the Philadelphia Beverage Tax. In the second year, the
      programs expanded to 2,250 Pre-K seats and 12 Community Schools before
      expanding to the current level of 3,300 Pre-K seats and 17 Community
      Schools in the following year. The number of Pre-K seats is currently
      budgeted to increase to 4,000 in FY22 and 4,300 in FY23, while the number
      of Community Schools is set to increase to 20 in FY23.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since FY17, the majority of Beverage Tax revenue has gone to the General
      Fund, where it remains untracked and can be used for other spending
      purposes. The administration has stated that spending associated with
      Beverage Tax revenue would be delayed due to pending litigation against
      the tax and would ramp up following the lawsuit’s end. However, the
      lawsuit was resolved in the City’s favor in in July 2018, and spending has
      remained lower than annual revenue in each year since.

        The data for individual expenditures is taken directly from the City of
        Philadelphia’s general ledger system (FAMIS), which the City uses to
        track spending and revenues.
        <ul>
          <li>
            In FAMIS, expenditures are categorized by major and minor classes.
            The major class provides a broad description of the spending, e.g.,
            payroll, while the minor classes give a more detailed description.
          </li>
          <li>
            Potentially sensitive information has been removed, and some
            formatting changes have been made for clarity.
          </li>
          <li>
            Negative expenditures can be recorded in FAMIS. They are sometimes
            necessary to offset other, possibly erroneous, spending items.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Revenue data reflects the latest information listed in FAMIS.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Revenues are reported on a modified accrual basis, meaning that the
            City considers revenues to be available if they are collected within
            60 days of the end of the current fiscal period. This means that
            some portion of the revenue that is collected during the first
            quarter of each fiscal year will be considered revenue from the
            prior fiscal year.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        In January 2020, the Office of Children and Families was created and
        began administering the Pre-K and Community School programs. Prior to
        this, the Mayor’s Office of Education was responsible for administering
        these programs. Spending data associated with “Program Administration”
        refers to spending by these two offices.
